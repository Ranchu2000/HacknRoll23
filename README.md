## Inspiration
With the global economic situation, layoffs in the tech industry have become more and more commonplace over the last few months. This has been dubbed by many as a ‘tech winter’, and this served as the main inspiration for our project, Jobpocalypse. 

## What it does
Jobpocalypse is a action shooter game in a retro 2D style, whereby the player takes on the role of Timmy, a graduating Computer Science student looking for a job. Timmy has to battle waves of HR recruiters with his trusty resume and overcome the sea of rejections to survive this tech winter.

Throughout this journey, Timmy will realise that the intro to data structures module that he took 2 years ago is of little relevance for “survival” (read employment) and will have to upgrade and build industry-relevant skills in order to beat back the recruiters.

Will Timmy emerge out of this job seeking hell? Or will he fall to the endless sea of rejections?

## How we built it
Jobpocalypse was built solely using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), which we used to access various interfaces of our computers to ease game development. 

The sprites utilised for this game are custom sprites that we created through LibreSprite and [INSERT MAPMAKER NAME].  + player sprite 


## Challenges we've faced
- Fully utilising the capabiliites of C++ as this is the first time the team developed a C++ project of this scale
- Balancing the game as this is the first time we dabbled into game development
- Collaborating on a OOP project where many components are interlinked
- Making the game more enjoyable- small details like pixelarting various movements and knockback
